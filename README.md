# Gateways-coole-Coding-trash-Ablage
This is a place where i document some of my code or not... I think thats why we are on github, arent we?
the code will be mainly written in java (if i code in another langueage, i will do //C++ or so)
I use for java the IntelliJ community edition which is free.
For html, css and js I use Visual Studio code.
And im planning on getting started with c++ in visual studio community.
